physics-cheatsheets
===================

A few "cheat sheets" (equation sheets) for undergraduate (possibly graduate) physics courses that I made as an undergrad.

Includes Electromagnetism I and II, Thermodynamics, Astrophysics, Cosmology and Numerical Techniques.

Disclaimer: these were originally made for personal, rapid reference; they should be fairly readable, but are not necessairly optimally organized.

Although these are good study tools, you'll learn and retain even more if you make your own!
