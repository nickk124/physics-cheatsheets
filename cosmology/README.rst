For an advanced undergraduate or graduate-level cosmology course.

Prerequisites 
=============
- Introductory astrophysics (see ``../astrophysics``)
- Quantum Mechanics I
- Classical Mechanics I (not introductory mechanics/kinematics; you'll need to know differential equations)

Topics
======

Parts 1-3 cover basics, and basic general relativity. 
Part 4 deals with cosmological energy content and distances (Friedmann equations).
Parts 5-10 cover particle statistics, and the early universe up to and including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. 
Parts 11-14 cover the (unperturbed) Cosmic Microwave Background.
Parts 14-17 cover Inflation.
Parts 18-20 introduce perturbation theory.
Parts 21-24 cover Inflationary perturbations.
Parts 25-28 cover the perturbed Boltzmann equations/particle statistics.
Parts 29-33 cover the perturbation-caused matter/energy and CMB observations.
